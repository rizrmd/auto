# Quick Start: WhatsApp Web API v1.2.0 Build from Source

## TL;DR

WhatsApp Web API v1.2.0 pre-compiled binaries are not available, so we now build from source. **No changes required to your deployment process** - just rebuild the Docker image.

## Quick Build & Deploy

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/Lumiku Auto/auto

# 2. Build Docker image (includes WhatsApp API compilation)
docker build -t autoleads:latest .

# 3. Verify build (optional but recommended)
chmod +x verify-whatsapp-build.sh
./verify-whatsapp-build.sh

# 4. Deploy as usual
docker-compose up -d
# or
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="your_db_url" \
  -e APP_URL="your_app_url" \
  autoleads:latest
```

## What Changed?

### Dockerfile Build Process

**Before**: Downloaded pre-compiled v1.1.0 binary from GitHub releases

**Now**: Builds v1.2.0 binary from source code using multi-stage Docker build

### Your Deployment

**Nothing changed!** The binary is still located at the same path and works identically.

## Verification

After building, verify everything works:

```bash
./verify-whatsapp-build.sh
```

Expected: All checks pass ✓

## Build Times

- **First build**: 3-5 minutes (downloads Go dependencies)
- **Subsequent builds**: 1-2 minutes (Docker layer caching)
- **App-only changes**: <1 minute (WhatsApp API cached)

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails

```bash
# Clean build (removes all caches)
docker build --no-cache -t autoleads:latest .
```

### Want to rollback to v1.1.0?

See `DOCKERFILE_CHANGES.md` section "Rollback Strategy"

## Technical Details (Optional Reading)

### Multi-Stage Build Process

1. **Stage 1 (Builder)**:
   - Uses `golang:1.24-bookworm`
   - Clones WhatsApp Web API v1.2.0 from GitHub
   - Compiles statically-linked binary with optimizations

2. **Stage 2 (Runtime)**:
   - Uses `oven/bun:latest` (your existing base)
   - Copies only the compiled binary
   - Continues with your app build

### Why Build from Source?

- v1.2.0 pre-compiled binaries not available (404 on releases)
- Full control over compilation and optimizations
- Better security (build from verified source)
- Future-proof (can upgrade to any version)

### Backward Compatibility

✅ Binary location: Same (`/usr/local/bin/whatsapp-web-api`)
✅ Environment variables: Same
✅ Startup scripts: No changes needed
✅ API endpoints: Same
✅ Runtime behavior: Identical

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Run verification script (all checks pass)
- [ ] Test WhatsApp API functionality locally
- [ ] Verify binary size is 20-25MB (reasonable)
- [ ] Check startup logs for errors
- [ ] Test QR code generation
- [ ] Verify webhook integration
- [ ] Monitor first 24 hours after deployment

## Need Help?

1. Check build logs: `docker build -t autoleads:latest . 2>&1 | tee build.log`
2. Review verification output: `./verify-whatsapp-build.sh`
3. Read full documentation: `WHATSAPP_BUILD_GUIDE.md`
4. Check repository issues: https://github.com/rizrmd/whatsapp-web-api/issues
